# netlogo_proteindiffusion_pnas
repository for the netlogo files used in "Plastocyanin is the long-range electron carrier between photosystem II and photosystem I in plants, Hoehner et al. 2020" 

Hello,

I used Netlogo v 6.0.4 (https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/) to model protein diffusion within the thylakoid membrane. If you download these files and open them in Netlogo, you can replicate our experiments. You'll have to modify the file location for the PNG background to whatever local path you use, but everything else should be ready to go. 

If you have any questions or think of something to improve on my methods here, feel free to email me at magnus.wood@wsu.edu. Have fun!
